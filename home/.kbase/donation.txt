Dear Mr/Mrs anonymous,

Kodachi first release was in 20-OCT-2013, since then if you are happy and protected with Linux Kodachi then my goal is achieved.
 
However I would appreciate your donation to continue developing it - Faster updates :p

Apart from my valuable time I do pay monthly rent for the vps servers hosting VPN nodes.

Let me know if you need to donate in different payment methods other than BTC (Like XMR,Zcoin,LTC,Zcash ...etc).
